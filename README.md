# chat
A chat application made using Node and Socket.io :)


# To use the app - 
Clone the repository, then
`npm install` inside the project directory.

Once the dependencies are installed
`npm start` in the same directory.

# Usage
Create a room or join an exisiting one. That's it.<br/> 
No chats are stored, so please do not use it as a backup for anything. Everything is deleted once the app is closed.
